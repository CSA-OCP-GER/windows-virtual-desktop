To save on cost some customers will want to spin down resources during off hours. Today the way to do that is with a schedule task. Runs as a scheduled task on a Windows VM in the subscription. Then you can also schedule a task to spin up resources before users log in for the day, thus saving many hours of Azure utilization.

Youâ€™ll see the above sample script does more of a soft drain mode, allowing user sessions to close out and take away Hosts when empty.
